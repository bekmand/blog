## Dataverse Error on table

If you have worked with Tables in dataverse and have touched the settings you might run into this issue

```

Serversvar: tablename mislykkedes: Principal user (Id=dfa3d87b-144a-ed11-bba1-6045bd8f9145, type=8, roleCount=4, privilegeCount=499, accessMode=0), 
is missing prvReadus__tableName privilege (Id=0a48faea-248b-455e-a18f-7aa9239cb846) on OTC=10280 for entity 'table logical name' 
(LocalizedName='table name'). context.Caller=dfa3d87b-144a-ed11-bba1-6045bd8f9145
```

## Understanding the error

```
Serversvar: tablename mislykkedes: Principal user (Id=dfa3d87b-144a-ed11-bba1-6045bd8f9145, type=8, roleCount=4, privilegeCount=499, accessMode=0), 
```

This part explains which user is having the issuee, please check the User table in Dataverse: Dataverse -> Tables -> User
show the field "User" this should be the key that you see above.


```
is missing prvReadus__tableName privilege (Id=0a48faea-248b-455e-a18f-7aa9239cb846) on OTC=10280 for entity 'table logical name' 
```

This tells us which table you're missing access to. In my case it is the table "us__tableName" 

Now all that is left is give the correct rights for that User to that Table and the error is resolved
